# Snaq A Food Pick-Up Ordering Website

Snaq is a food pick-up web app that embeds into restaurant's websites and provides a back-end for order management.

Customers can select one or more dishes and place an order for pickup. Using the Twilio API, customers recieve an SMS notification with their estimated wait time and another when their order is ready. The restaurant also receives an SMS alert when an order is received. Snaq serves as an intermediary.
Snaq also has an admin portal that allows for restaurant owners to provide wait times and mark orders as complete.

This website was built by Patrice Pavico, Gonzo Nieto, and Julia Tran using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, Ajax, EJS, and PostgreSQL.
